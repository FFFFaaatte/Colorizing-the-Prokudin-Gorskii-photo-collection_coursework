# Colorizing-the-Prokudin-Gorskii-photo-collection_coursework

Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorsii was the first to invent color photography in an interesting way. The method was that he took three pictures of each object, each time with a different color filter (green, blue and red filters).  His purpose was to combine each of these images to make a colorful image. 
Although making these color photos may seem straightforward at first, if we simply put the images of each filter on each other, we will find that due to the small differences in the images, they do not match well, and the results are not good. 
This coursework aims to use a simple method to improve the results of the combination of the images and obtain a high-quality color photo.
